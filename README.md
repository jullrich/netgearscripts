Misc. Helper Scripts for Netgear Switches
=========================================

netgearfirmware.sh: Downloads current firmware versions from Netgear Site

netgearreboot.sh: Reboot Switch

netbearpoe.sh: power on/off/cycle POE on a switch port

netgearcheckfirmware.sh: Check current firmware version

NB: These are scripts I wrote for my own use. They are only tested using the limited number of devices I own. Feel free to extend.
